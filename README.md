# Battleship
Single player battleship

This was a project from my OOP in Java class.  The rubric required use of 2 dimensional arrays in 3 difficulty levels that
determine the size of the board (beginner = 6x6, standard = 9x9 and advanced = 12x12).  This game is single player (no A.I.).
The goal is to sink all ships before running out of missiles (30 for beginner, 50 for standard, 75 for advanced).  The rubric 
also required the optional display of ship coordinates for testing which is accomplished here using side-by-side 2 dimensional 
arrays.
